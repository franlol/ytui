# Skills

Skills are reusable agent procedures.

Executable skill definitions are stored in `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
This folder documents skill expectations and governance constraints.

Each skill follows `../contracts/skill-interface.md`.
Each execution output follows `../contracts/output-format.md`.

Core skills include architecture, store, provider, UI, plugin, release, and docs sync guardians.
