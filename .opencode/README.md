# OpenCode Runtime Definitions

This directory contains executable OpenCode definitions used by agents at runtime.

- `agents/`: custom agent definitions (`*.md` with frontmatter)
- `commands/`: slash commands (`*.md` with frontmatter and prompt template)
- `skills/`: skill folders with `SKILL.md` and required frontmatter

These files complement policy/spec docs in `docs/`.
